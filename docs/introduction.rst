For a more detailed explanation, see *The cui et al systematic review paper*. The methods in this library are based on the taxonomy they propose.

Who will get the most out of FuseIt?
------------------------------------

You might want to use FuseIt if:

1. You've got some multimodal data: this library supports two types of tabular data and either 2D or 3D image data.
2. You want to use multimodal fusion! This library supports a variety of fusion methods, including:
    - early fusion
    - late fusion
    - operation-based fusion
    - attention-based fusion
    - subspace-based fusion
    - tensor-based fusion
    - graph-based fusion
    - (and uni-modal models for comparison)


Why FuseIt?
------------

1. Florence is super cool
2. She's the best
3. And really good at coding
4. especially coding multimodal fusion models
